# exciting-playground
This is sort of a crazy experimental zone for me... so be aware of that.

Currently, this project is very empty. I keep it around so that I can keep track of lessons that I've learned. I also want the ability to be able to go through the git history and load an earlier state should I ever need to relearn that lesson.

# Lessons Learned so far
* Late Oct 2015 - Understand the premise of a login app: see 'fixed-gateway' project
* Early Oct 2015 - Understand React.js actions: see 'studious-display'

# Sources of inpsiration
* Hackathon Starter - https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter
* redux - https://github.com/reactjs/redux
